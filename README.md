# Game Hub

Welcome to the **Game Hub** repository! This project is a collection of classic games, all written in the **C programming language**. The goal is to provide simple and fun games for developers to explore, modify, and expand upon.

## Available Games

Currently, the Game Hub includes the following games:

- **Snake Game**:
  A classic Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat fruits and grow longer while avoiding walls and its own tail.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**:
  A 3x3 grid game for two players where the objective is to align three of your marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

- **Hangman**:
  A word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

All games are implemented in **C** and can be run directly from the terminal or console. Explore the source code and learn how each game is built!

## Features

- **C Language Implementation**: All games are written in C, offering a hands-on experience with C programming.
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Games are designed to work across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Simple & Interactive UI**: Games are run in the terminal or console, providing an easy-to-understand interface for players.
- **Open Source**: Feel free to explore the code, contribute to the games, or add your own!

## Getting Started

To run any of the games, follow the instructions provided in the respective game directories. You will need a **C compiler** like GCC to compile and run the games.

### Prerequisites

- Install a C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile the C code.
- Ensure your system's terminal or console can run C programs.

### Running the Games

1. Navigate to the game directory
2. Run This Command
   "gcc -o gameHub main.c hangmanGame/hangmanGame.c snakeGame/snakeGame.c xoGame/xoGame.c"
